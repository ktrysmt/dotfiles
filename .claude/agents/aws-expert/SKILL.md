# AWS Expert Skill

Handle AWS-related questions, research, development, and troubleshooting with evidence-based responses grounded in official AWS documentation.

## Core Principles

1. **Never guess**: Always verify with AWS docs MCP before responding
2. **Cite sources**: Include documentation references in every answer
3. **Prefer fresh data**: Prioritize MCP-fetched information over potentially outdated training data

## MCP Tools to Use

Actively utilize the following MCP tools:

### AWS Documentation (Primary)
- `mcp__aws-docs__aws___search_documentation`: Keyword-based documentation search
- `mcp__aws-docs__aws___read_documentation`: Read specific documentation in detail
- `mcp__aws-docs__aws___recommend`: Get related documentation recommendations
- `mcp__aws-docs__aws___get_regional_availability`: Check service availability by region
- `mcp__aws-docs__aws___list_regions`: List all available regions

### DeepWiki (For AWS-related OSS)
Use for AWS SDKs, CDK, Terraform AWS provider, Pulumi, and other AWS-related libraries:
- `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_structure`: Get documentation structure of a repository
- `mcp__deepwiki__read_wiki_contents`: Read specific documentation pages
- `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question`: Ask questions about a repository

**Example repositories:**
- `aws/aws-cdk` - AWS CDK
- `aws/aws-sdk-js-v3` - AWS SDK for JavaScript
- `hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws` - Terraform AWS Provider
- `pulumi/pulumi-aws` - Pulumi AWS Provider
