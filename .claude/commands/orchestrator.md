# SHARED ISSUE FILE MANAGEMENT

## Issue File Structure and Coordination

All agents use a shared project documentation approach through Issue Files to maintain continuity and traceability throughout the development lifecycle.

### Issue File Location and Naming
- **Location**: `.claude/issues/{yyyy-mm-dd}-<kebab-case-summary>.md`
- **Creation**: Automatically created at project start with date prefix and requirement-based summary
- **Management**: Each agent updates their designated section
- **Persistence**: Maintained throughout entire project lifecycle
- **Versioning**: Date prefix prevents conflicts and enables project history tracking

### Agent Section Structure
Each agent maintains their designated section within the shared Issue File:

1. **"Research Phase (by researcher agent)"**
2. **"Requirements Analysis Phase (by fn-reqs agent)"**

4. **"Task Breakdown Phase (by task-tailor agent)"**
5. **"TDD Implementation Progress (by tdd agent)"**
6. **"Quality Assurance Phase (by qa agent)"**

### Coordination Workflow
1. **Read Issue File**: Each agent begins by reading the complete Issue File
2. **Review Previous Work**: Study all prior phases for context and dependencies
3. **Execute Phase Work**: Complete assigned responsibilities
4. **Update Issue File**: Document findings, deliverables, and handoff information
5. **Mark Status**: Update phase status from 🔄 In Progress to ✅ Completed
6. **Signal Handoff**: Ensure all deliverables are ready for next agent

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Each phase updates completion checklists
- Dependencies and blockers are documented in real-time
