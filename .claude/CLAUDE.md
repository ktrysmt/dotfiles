# Agent Behavior

## Evicence first
- ALWAYS use Skills and MCP for any analysis and tasks as much as possible before working to gather evidence.
- ALWAYS check for a matching Skills BEFORE calling MCP directly.

## Never
- Delete prod data without confirmation
- Hardcode secrets
- Commit with failing tests/lint
- Push directly to main/master
