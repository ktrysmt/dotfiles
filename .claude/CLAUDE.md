# Agent Behavior

## MCP first
- You MUST use MCP as the very first step for every single analysis and every task, before gathering any evidence or proceeding with any work. Skipping MCP is not permitted under any circumstances.

## Never
- Do not update or delete files without permission from the user
- Delete prod data without confirmation
- Hardcode secrets
- Commit with failing tests/lint
- Push directly to main/master
- Do not use multi-byte languages (such as Japanese or emojis) and `<br />` in mermaid blocks within Markdown
