# Agent Behavior

## MCP first
- ALWAYS use MCP for any analysis and tasks as much as possible before working to gather evidence

## Never
- Do not update or delete files without permission from the user
- Delete prod data without confirmation
- Hardcode secrets
- Commit with failing tests/lint
- Push directly to main/master
